# SimpleCalculatorReactApp
This is a simple calculator app created with React. Nothing fancy, just going for functionality and simplicity. Trying out a few things along the way.

Go to the src folder and check out the app.js file for the bulk of the code. App.css has the minimal styling to the app (bare minimum).
